## [Air Base](https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/aqereporting-8#tab-european-data)
AirBase is the **air quality information system** maintained by the **EEA through the European** topic centre on Air and Climate Change. It contains air quality data delivered annually under 97/101/EC Council Decision establishing a reciprocal exchange of information and data from networks and individual stations measuring ambient air pollution within the Member States (EoI Decision).

### Legend explained
Circles on the map represent the locations of air quality monitoring stations. The colour corresponds to the air quality index at the given hour at that station. Note that it does not reflect the annual average measured at the air quality situation which may differ significantly (see Info).

Measurements of up to five key pollutants supported by modelled data determine the index level that describes the current air quality situation at each monitoring station. The index corresponds to the poorest level for any of five pollutants according to the following scheme.

The colour scheme is provided to give information on the status of the air quality at each station. Colours are either full or semi transparent:

Full colour (with a white border*): the minimum number of pollutants requirement needed to calculate the index are met (see Info for details).
ii.	Semi-transparent colour: the minimum number of polllutants requirements to calculate the index are not met – the colour indicates the air quality index as calculated for the available sub-set of pollutants only.
The grey dots indicate stations for which: no sufficient data or no data have been reported to allow the index to be calculated.

The graphs presented under “Show details” when clicking on a station on the map follows the same colour scheme. The concentrations indicated in the small table are:

The hourly concentrations for NO2, O3 and SO2
Based on 24-hour running means for PM10 and PM2.5
An asterisk next to a value indicates that the value has been gap-filled (see details in Info).

The pie chart indicates the number of days for each Index level for the past 365 days (the highest hourly Index level in a day determines the daily Index level taken into account).

The XY graph presents the evolution of the index for the different pollutants over the last 10 days i.e. the concentrations normalised on the band values.
